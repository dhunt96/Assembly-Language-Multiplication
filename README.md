# Assembly-Language-Multiplication
Using MARIE (Machine Architecture that is Really Intuitive and Easy), this program can multiply two numbers together (including negatives). The challenge comes from the fact that MARIE does not support multiplication commands!


This repository includes the MARIE program itself. To run my program, execute the MARIE program and load the "Multiplication File." Run the program, and in the "input" field, enter the first number, and then the second that you would like to multiply. For more accurate results, ensure that the value type of the input and output fields are set to "decimal."
